# Example eBook: *The Call of the Wild*, by Jack London

The `epub` directory contains an example of an eBook that was generated by *scriv2epub*. The starting point in this case was not a Scrivener project but a palin text version of Jack London's *The Call of The Wild" from [Project Gutenberg](http://gutenberg.org) (see file `pg215.txt` in this directory). The manual text wrangling was done with `csplit` and `pandoc` to split the source into the different chapters in subdirectory `epub/src`. The metadata files `meta.yaml` and `mainmatter.yaml` were created manually. Togehter with the source files and the EPUB output (`epub/call_of_the_wild.epub`) these should give a good impression of how the different bits and pieces work together.
